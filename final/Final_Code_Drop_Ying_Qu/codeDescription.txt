\f0\fs24 \cf0 The test.java code is to deal with yelp dataset as json format. \
All the information I need from the yelp dataset is name, stars, address, category,15 attributes: take-out, takes reservations, caters, delivery, parking, has tv, music, outdoor seating, accepts credit cards, waiter service, good for kids, good for groups, wheelchair accessible, happy hour, by appointment only.\
I made a score criterion:
\f1\fs22 \CocoaLigature0  score = star * \cf2 20\cf0  * \cf2 0.85\cf0  + attributesMark *\cf2 100\cf0 /\cf2 15\cf0 * \cf2 0.15\cf0  to calculate every restaurant\'92s score.\
The output of the test.java is in the format of name, cuisine, score, address.\
And the output will be collected by Zhibin Li for map reduce to get the final data I need to use for rank.\
\
The rank.java is to collect all the need information from yelp,Facebook,zagat and twitter and to make a rank according to the score from Facebook,yelp, zagat and the count from yelp and twitter.\
\
I made a criterion: tempScore = zagat * \cf2 0.3\cf0  + yelp * \cf2 0.45\cf0 + facebook*\cf2 0.15\cf0  + occurrence/maxOccurrence*\cf2 100\cf0 *\cf2 0.1\cf0 ;//zagat:yelp:facebook=2:3:1\
\
The output will be the rank of the french restaurant in nyc and its final score.\
