Code Description - Zhibin Li

python code:
The dataset of zagat is grabbed through the zagat's website. Since the review and rating are dynamic generated by javascript code, I use python selenium library to simulate human web browsing behavior; then use beautiful soup library to process the HTML content of DOM. The review and rating then are output as file.

Java code:
The Java code is used for implementing MapReduce function. It processed the datasets from twitter, yelp, facebook and zagat. Then output a final grading file for the purpose of rankings.
